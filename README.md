# MachineLearning
This project uses Machine Learning to predict customer churn. Steps include normalizing data, creating dummy variables, splitting data into training and testing sets, scaling features, training models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), and optimizing hyperparameters to improve predictions.
